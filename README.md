# AddressInShardGenerator

This script allows you to generate a wallet in the TON network within a specified user's shard. The wallet is generated based on the user's input for the desired wallet address and the number of matching bits.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 

## Installation

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```

After executing this command, the script will ask you to input:

1. The address to which you want to generate your wallet.

2. The number of bits for the address match (to ensure the address falls within a certain shard).
